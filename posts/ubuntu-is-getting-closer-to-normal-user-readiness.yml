 Note the use of the relative term "closer", folks.
 
 The reason this comes up now is that I did a clean install of Ubuntu 8.10 last night (9.04, I felt, would be a bit adventurous for my "must work" machine). Damn, it was easy! Better than Windows XP, and Vista as well, from the little I remember. It took about half an hour, and about 5 clicks, and it took me to a working install with all the basic software (e.g. FF3, OpenOffice, media player, everything my mum would need). No mucking about with hardware drivers, either. (Caveat: I haven't tried this with interesting hardware like WiFi or bluetooth. That stuff could make it fall in a screaming heap, for all I know.)
 
 I haven't had too much time to explore it yet, but I'm still impressed that I can go from zero to useful in under an hour. If nothing else, it's a great "rescue" option - as is the live CD route, I guess. But why would you when a normal install is so easy? (I know, I know, there are reasons.)
 
 I'm impressed. GO LINUX!!
