markdown: "DISCLAIMER: I maintain\xC2\xA0the code that I refer to in this post, but I didn't\xC2\xA0<em>write</em>\xC2\xA0the code.\n\n\n\n\
  I've been hunting HTTP 404 errors (that's the \"File Not Found\" variety), and today I came across a bit of a puzzler. The non-existent image files were being referred to by a stylesheet as part of a CSS\xC2\xA0<code>background:</code>\xC2\xA0instruction, but the rule that contained the instruction was never invoked. That is, the rule was for a class name that was never used.\n\n\n\n\
  How the hell \xC2\xA0was I getting these image requests if the code that started the requests was never being used?\n\n\n\n\
  Then I noticed that the errors were coming from just a few different user agents. And they all had something about them...\n\n\

  See it? That's right, they all come from mobile browsers. This puzzled me a bit, until I realised that it might be something you'd do to speed up the user experience if you knew they'd be on a slow connection (and you didn't care if they downloaded heaps of data they didn't need).\n\n\n\n\
  So here's the piece of knowledge I want to add to the internet (he said, arrogantly assuming it wasn't there already):\xC2\xA0<strong>Mobile browsers prefetch images from stylesheets as an optimisation in the face of low speed connections.</strong>\n\n\n\n\
  You're welcome."
