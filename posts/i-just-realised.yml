 [GitHub](https://github.com)'s new "create a file here" feature means that I can post to my blog directly from the GitHub website. As long as I'm willing to type in the YAML template myself, anyway. The template is stored as a Quicksilver shortcut on my home machine - perhaps I should consider making it more widely accessible.
 
 So there are still a couple of tricky bits in this process, but at least now I don't need a machine with Git installed just to write.
 
 Thanks, GitHub!
