 There are a few challenges in developing a templating engine, and I think I've solved one of them for this framework: including templates inside other templates.
 
 To include another template, you use something like the following syntax:
 
 <code>&lt;&lt;template_name { yaml: hash, including: data, to: be, passed: to, the: template } &gt;&gt;</code>
 
 Challenges still to be overcome include *repetition* (adding the same template repeatedly for a list of data objects) and *conditionality* (only showing the template if certain conditions are true).
 
 You can see it in action [here](/posts/burnie-by-night.html).
