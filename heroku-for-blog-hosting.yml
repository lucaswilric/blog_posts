 I [read an article](http://bugsplat.info/2012-11-05-introduction-to-heroku-buildpacks.html) today which got me pondering the idea of hosting this blog on [Heroku](https://heroku.com). That seems incongruous when we're talking about a site that's hosted as static HTML, but it would make the deployment process somewhat quicker.
 
 That said, I could probably achieve exactly the same through the clever use of [git's handy event hooks](http://www.githooks.com/). Which is, of course, exactly how Heroku does its magic.
