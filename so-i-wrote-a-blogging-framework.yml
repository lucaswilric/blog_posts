  A little while ago I wrote a post about an idea I had for a version control-backed blogging system. <a href="http://blog-experiment.lucasrichter.id.au/">Here is an early version in action</a>.
  
  
  
  I wrote a post <a href="http://blog-experiment.lucasrichter.id.au/posts/so-i-built-a-blogging-framework.html">over there</a> that has a bit more information, if that kind of thing tickles your nerdy fancy.
  
  
  
  Enjoy, and let me know what you think!
